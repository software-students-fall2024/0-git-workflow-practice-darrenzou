The article talks about he key aspects of a good programmer. It highlights 5 main elements, problem solving or problem decomposition, scenario analysis, naming, consistency, and learning. The most interesting parts of this article is the importance of naming and readability of code. Consistency and naming are two aspects that directly affect how easy to read the code is and they are 2 out of the 5 most important aspects of a programmer. While the other three have obvious connections to programming as a science, naming and consistency seems like how computer scientists communicate with each other.
